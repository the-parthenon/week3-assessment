        Hello, and welcome to this website! It's not Zombo.com, but you can still do
        pretty much anything while your here (local laws and regulations do apply, please
        keep it civil).
      </p>

      <p>
        Simply by visiting this very site, we are able to determine the following things
        about you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        • You are a person of genuinely good taste.<br />
      </ul>
      <ul>
        • You probably haven't actively made anyone cry in at least one week.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        • It is more than likely that when people think of you, they are reminded of the
        smell of cinnamon (or possibly lavender).
      </ul>
