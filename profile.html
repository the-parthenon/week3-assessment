        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
          I have a multitude of skills, but for the purposes of personal safety, I choose
          to keep many of them secret. If you
          <a id="secret">click</a> the correct place on this Internet website, I might
          consider sharing one or more of them with you.

        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>
          I have been told that I should have started a retirement fund at a very young
          age and, because of compound interest, I might now be a millionaire. I did not
          do this when I was young because I am silly. That is primarily what I know about
          interests.

        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>
          I would certainly like to get a career at some point. DevMountain is helping
          with that. Soon, I will analyze all of the data and find somebody to pay me for
          it, which is more than I can say about my previous plan to feed myself via
          philosophy. Sigh.
